### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

We are exploring trends in toxic releases across the United States, specifically looking at industry types, location of releases, presence of carcinogens, and types of chemicals or metals released.

### KEY AREAS TO ADDRESS:

1. The relationship between industry type and toxic release volume and location, with the ability to filter by carcinogen and federal companies (map)
2. By company, comparing the unique chemical profiles released as well as the breakdown of (onsite, offsite, and recycling volumes) (dropdown/table/pie)
3. By region (including Tribal lands), comparing total release volumes, carcinogens
